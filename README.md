# Todo list app 2 :ballot_box_with_check:

This is very simple todo list app created with React using the hooks. It helped me to understand how hooks work and how they can be implemented in to any app.

To run this app just write:
`npm install`
into your command line and then:
`npm start`

This app was inspired by the Section 33 in [The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router)](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WbGAEYZeVhUQn8B/).
